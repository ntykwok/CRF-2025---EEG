The EEG data, spindle information, and staging results of ten participants are included here. 

Each of them experiences two consecutive naps, using the term 'session' to describe. The first session is the adaptation nap, during which participants experience natural sleep. The second session is the experiment nap, during which participants experience auditory stimulation during sleep.




*** EEG data description ***

1. Sampling rate: 250Hz
2. Channels (raw data): ['C3', 'C4', 'Cz', 'EOG1', 'EOG2', 'EMG1','EMG2','Aux1','Aux2']
   ‘Aux1’: M1 (bilateral mastoids), used for re-reference
   ‘Aux2’: M2 (bilateral mastoids), used for re-reference
3. Online reference: Cpz
4. Impedances: ≤20kΩ
5. Original EEG recording: 64-channel (eego, eemagine, ANT, The Netherlands) 
5. File description: saved in BrainVision format, including '.eeg', '.vhdr', and '.vmrk' files.



*** Spindle information description ***

1. Spindle information saved as '.mat' files. From left to right, the columns are the time (second) of spindle onset (start), spindle offset (end), and spindle peak.
2. Spindle detection cite 'Old Brains Come Uncoupled in Sleep: Slow Wave-Spindle Synchrony, Brain Atrophy, and Forgetting'.



***  Staging results ***

1. Sampling rate: 1/30s
2. Sleep staging was initially performed using YASA (a Python library for sleep data analysis), and then double-checked by two experimenters.
3. Staging results and figures are shared.


(Note: participants sleep better in session 1 than in session 2 because of auditory stimulation was applied in seesion 2 that would impact sleep quality.)
